## Heap
  - `dmh` to see heap memory

## Pattern generator / Offset finder
  - `wop` . Example: `wop 100 @ eax`

## Pattern searches
  - Use `/p [int]` to search for repeated patterns. The int specifies the length of the pattern. Could be helpful in finding user input accross the binary.
  - Search for asm opcodes by using `/a` . Example `/a jmp esp` .
