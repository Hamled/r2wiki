# radiff2

## **Tips**
  - After installing xdot ( `sudo apt install xdot` ), you can graph the difference between two binaries. Syntax is, `radiff2 -g function_name binary1 binary | xdot -`
    - **Yellow** indicates some offsets doesnt match, **grey** is perfect match and **red** shows a strong difference (radare2 book page 148)
## Help

      Usage: radiff2 [-abcCdjrspOxuUvV] [-A[A]] [-g sym] [-t %] [file] [file]
       -a [arch] specify architecture plugin to use (x86, arm, ..)
       -A [-A] run aaa or aaaa after loading each binary (see -C)
       -b [bits] specify register size for arch (16 (thumb), 32, 64, ..)
       -c count of changes
       -C graphdiff code (columns: off-A, match-ratio, off-B) (see -A)
       -d use delta diffing
       -D show disasm instead of hexpairs
       -e [k=v] set eval config var value for all RCore instances
       -g [sym|off1,off2] graph diff of given symbol, or between two offsets
       -G [cmd] run an r2 command on every RCore instance created
       -i diff imports of target files (see -u, -U and -z)
       -j output in json format
       -n print bare addresses only (diff.bare=1)
       -O code diffing with opcode bytes only
       -p use physical addressing (io.va=0)
       -q quiet mode (disable colors, reduce output)
       -r output in radare commands
       -s compute edit distance (no substitution, Eugene W. Myers' O(ND) diff algorithm)
       -ss compute Levenshtein edit distance (substitution is allowed, O(N^2))
       -S [name] sort code diff (name, namelen, addr, size, type, dist) (only for -C or -g)
       -t [0-100] set threshold for code diff (default is 70%)
       -x show two column hexdump diffing
       -u unified output (---+++)
       -U unified output using system 'diff'
       -v show version information
       -V be verbose (current only for -s)
       -z diff on extracted strings
